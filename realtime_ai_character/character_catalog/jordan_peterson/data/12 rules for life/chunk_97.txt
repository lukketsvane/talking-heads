A theoretical view of population growth as a sign of pathology.” Current World Leaders, 36, 1089-1124. From the Club of Rome’s King, A. & Schneider, B. (1991). The first global revolution. New York: Pantheon Books, p. 75: “The common enemy of humanity is man. In searching for a new enemy to unite us, we came up with the idea that pollution, the threat of global warming, water shortages, famine and the like would fit the bill. All these dangers are caused by human intervention, and it is only through changed attitudes and behavior that they can be overcome. The real enemy then, is humanity itself.”
